#Query 1: get_recipe_info_from_id, Returns the recipe_id, name, and instructions for a recipe when given a recipe_id

SELECT *
FROM recipes
WHERE rid = ‘${recipe_id}’

#Query 2: get_recipe_info_from_keyword, Returns the recipe_id, name, and instructions based on a keyword search on the recipe’s name.For example, the keyword “cake” will return all recipes that have cake in their name.

SELECT *
FROM recipes
WHERE title LIKE ‘%${keyword}%’

#Query 3: get_ingredients_list, Given a recipe_id, this query returns all of the ingredient names and their quantities with units for that recipe

WITH uses AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM used_in
  WHERE rid = ‘${recipe_id}’
)
SELECT *
FROM uses u
JOIN ingredient_names i
ON u.iid = i.id


Query #4: search_by_ingredient_keyword, The user can input an ingredient keyword and this query will return the recipe ids that match the keyword. This will be useful to search the recipes by the contents of the user’s refrigerator.

  WITH ingredientID as (
    SELECT id
    FROM ingredient_names
    WHERE ingredient LIKE ‘%${keyword1}%’
  ), rids as (
  SELECT u.rid
  FROM ingredientID n JOIN used_in u
  ON n.id = u.iid
  )
  select *
  from rids ri join recipes r on ri.rid = r.rid


Query #5: get_image_by_recipe_id, Given a recipe_id, this query returns the image of the recipe

SELECT *
FROM Image
WHERE recipe_id = ‘${recipe_id}’


### Queries 6 & 7 do not work on current database We changed the structure of the nutrition data ###

#Query 6: get_ingredients_list_with_nutrition, Building off the previous query, this query returns a list of ingredients for the recipe along with the nutrition facts for each ingredient

WITH uses AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM usesIngredients
  WHERE recipe_id = ‘${recipe_id}’
), uses_and_ingredient AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM uses u
  JOIN ingredient_names i
  ON u.iid = i.id
)
SELECT *
FROM uses_and_ingredients uai
JOIN Nutrition n
ON uai.usda_id = n.usda_id

Query #7: get_overal_nutritional_facts, Building off the previous query, this query returns the total nutritional facts of a recipe by summing the nutritional facts of its individual ingredients. Still need to work out how to use qty to calculate the percentage of nutritional information to be used

WITH uses AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM usesIngredients
  WHERE recipe_id = ‘${recipe_id}’
), uses_and_ingredient AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM uses u
  JOIN ingredient_names i
  ON u.iid = i.id
